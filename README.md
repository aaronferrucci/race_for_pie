# Run For Pie
The 4th annual Run For Pie happened this Thanksgiving, 2015 in Aptos.
Results are here:

(Yes, the URL contains "2016", but 2015 data is there. They'll probably break
the link at some point, but this repo has a snapshot of the data.)

As seems to be the case for footraces in general, data can be downloaded, but
visualization is minimal. Hence this project.
